Key Features:

Detailed Problem Descriptions - Clear problem statements with examples
Algorithm Analysis - Time/space complexity for both solutions
Implementation Details - Explanation of the approaches used
Practical Applications - Real-world use cases for both algorithms
Compilation Instructions - How to build and run the code
Learning Objectives - What concepts these problems teach

For N-Queens Code:
I analyzed implementation and noted that it uses:

Backtracking approach with recursive solution
Efficient safety checking (only checks upward directions)
Clean string-based board representation
Proper constraint satisfaction methodology
